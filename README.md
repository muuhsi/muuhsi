🛡️ **About Me**

I'm a passionate cybersecurity practitioner interested in both **attacking** and **defending** systems. My goal is to understand the full attack lifecycle — from reconnaissance to exploitation, and from detection to response. I actively explore red teaming tactics while also working on building strong detection strategies.
